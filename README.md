# Hades

Hades is a minimal colorscheme based on [Apprentice](https://github.com/romainl/Apprentice).

## Design

The theme simply uses `vim.api.nvim_set_hl` to set highlight colors and does not aim to provide any customisability.
I started with setting all syntax highlights to white, adding color only when I feel it is needed.
The color palette is soft and contrast is low.
